<h1> About Me </h1>
<img> meandkristina <img>
<p> I am a Christian Ministry major from North Carolina. I enjoy a wide range of things from shooting, longboarding, camping, video gaming, Dungeons and Dragons, podcasting, and motorcycles. <br> My favorite thing in life is my family though. </p>
	<h2> Podcasting </h2>
<p> Me and my best friend Nick started a podcast two years ago called Unhinged Antics. Here's a link if you want to check it out. <link> <a https://www.facebook.com/unhingedantics/
	<br> <h2>Longboarding</h2>
<p> Been longboarding for a long time. <br> <img> longboard.jpg <img> </p>
